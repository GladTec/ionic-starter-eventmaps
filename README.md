This is an addon starter template based on my [ionic-starter-requirejs template](https://github.com/KillerCodeMonkey/ionic-starter-requirejs) for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). It is a base event app with the usage of Google Maps (custom directive).

## How to use this template

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project.

Or use the files from ionic market:
[Go](http://market.ionic.io/starters/event-app-and-maps)

It is a clean project without external dependencies!

After that!!!:

- go in www folder then app and directives
- there open the googleMaps.js and change the Google Maps apiKey with yours

Finding something in the democontent:
Type in 'Berlin', 'Ber', 'Sports' or 'DÃ¼sseldorf'

## Content

- Handling possible backend-requests in services -> add your backend easy and fast!
- mockdata
- simulate backend connections with promises and timeouts -> you can check possible loading spinners and so on
- simple and only a little bit scss styling
- usage of ionRefresher, infiniteScroll, ionSpinner, Popups, Modals -> if you are new in ionic you can see all this in action
