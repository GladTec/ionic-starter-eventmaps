This is an addon starter template based on [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) for the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) for event apps with the usage of Google Maps (custom directive).

## How to use this template

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project.

It is a clean project without external dependencies!

After that!!!:

- go in www folder then app and directives
